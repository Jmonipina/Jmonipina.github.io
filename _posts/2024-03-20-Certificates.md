Outside of online tutorials like those offered on Youtube, this was my first exposure to structured courses. These have allowed me to gain a greater knowledge of using C++ and C# within game engines.
During these courses we were encouraged to think of our own solutions to issues before moving on within the course, which also introduced us to using the documentation websites for Unreal and Unity alike.
